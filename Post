Battle mode:

**Overview**

FlingDash is a game somewhat based off of FlingSmash, a Wii game I loved as a kid. It's a PvP game with two modes, racing and battling.

In race mode, you race against other players through a course full of traps and obstacles, and the first one to reach the end wins.

In battle mode, you fight MarioKart style with power-ups in a small map. There are power-up boxes scattered throughout the map, which giveyou a random power-ups when you hit them. When someone hits you with a power-up, you lose health, and when you die you respawn and the one who hit you gets a point. When the time is up, whoever has the most points wins.

There are different maps for race and battle mode. Every game a random one is chosen.

You gain experience from playing games, and at every experience milestone you level up. 

**In-game currency**
This I'll need help with, besides for cosmetics I have no idea what the in-game currency can be used for.

**Monetization**
I really need help with this area too.

- In-game currency which can be bought with robux.

Can't really think of anything else.

**Concerns**

What will levelling up do? Is it just for show? I want people to have something to grind towards, like, "when I level up to level 5, I'll get X," or "when I get 500 [currency] I can get X," but I'm not sure what "X" would be, other than cosmetics, which isn't that exciting. If there aren't cool stuff that you can buy or can get when you level up to a certain level, the game wouldn't be as exciting.

Please let me know if you like or dislike the game concept and if you have any ideas about monetization, what the in-game currency can be used for, and what levelling up would do.
